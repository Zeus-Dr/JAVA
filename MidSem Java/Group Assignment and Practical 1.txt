Qtn: Write a java programme with atleast two
classes i.e a main class and another. In the
main class create objects of the other and
invoke the methods.

In the other class define the following 
methods

1.a method which, given an integer n, 
classifies it as "perfect", "abundant", 
or "deficient".

A number is perfect if the sum of its 
divisors (excluding the number itself) 
is equal to the number, eg 6.

A number is abundant if the sum of its 
divisors (excluding the number itself) 
is greater than the number, eg 12.

A number is deficient if it is neither 
perfect nor abundant.

2. a method which, given an array of 
characters and an integer max, returns 
"TRUE" if the first max characters form 
a palindrome (the same spelt backwards 
and forwards, eg, civic), and "FALSE"
otherwise.

Note:

(i) clearly show the instance variables 
in class two
(ii) clearly show the constructors in 
class two
(iii) clearly show the methods in class two
(iv) do not hard code the inputs

---------------------------------

Week1 Assignment
---------------------------------
Write a java program with main and other
two classes. The following should be 
implemented,each one in its own class. 

1. a method that takes an array of integers,
it determines whether an array is vanilla
or not. If its a vanilla array, it returns
1 otherwise 0.

note: an array is vanilla if all the digits
of its elements are the same e.g
{1,11,1111,111,1} is a vanilla array
{2222,22,2222222,2} is a vanilla array
{101,11,1111,1} is not a vanilla array

Use a single dimentional array
You can hard code the elements of the array

2. a method that takes an integer n, it
determines whether n is isolated. If its
isolated it returns 1 otherwise 0.

note: a number n is isolated if non of the 
digits of its square are found it its cube

e.g 

163 is isolated because

(163*163=26569) and (163*163*163=4330747)

while 162 is not isolated because

(162*162=26244) and (162*162*162=4251528)

Week2 Group Assignment
-------------------------
Qtn: Using Arrays and Classes
implement the following
-create classes
-include instance variables
-create inheritence
-create objects
-execute methods

There are 5 students in a class
capture the following
-SurNames, FirstNames, Ages
Sex.

-Capture their marks of 
three subjects

-Calcuate the average mark
of each student and display
it.

-Determine a student who
fails or passes. i.e 
if average mark.

note: all marks are integers
>=0 and <=100 (i.e, the 
program should refuse
wrong data enty, hint
capture the exceptions)
 < 50, the student fails

--------------------------

Week3 Assignment
---------------------------
refer to the diagram in
the .doc file

create an abstract parent
called person with an 
abstract method called
backgroundInformation()

implement the abstract
method within child classes
i.e, Employee and student

Note:

Make the Employee parent
of Manager and ship all
the code of week2 assignment
under student class.

-out put some employees and 
students information

classes parents of Manager and 
 hello
